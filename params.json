It includes the python interpreter itself, the python standard library as well as a set of packages exposing data structures and methods for data manipulation and scientific computing and visualization. In particular it provides Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn and statmodels. The full list of packages is available at:\r\n\r\n[http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkgs.html](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkgs.html)\r\n\r\nThe Anaconda python distribution must be downloaded from:\r\n\r\n[http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads)\r\n\r\nFor your platform.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed Anaconda, you can update to the latest compatible versions of all the pre-installed libraries by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconda update conda\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen\r\n\r\n```\r\nconda update anaconda\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a terminal.\r\n\r\nYou also need to install [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip) to install packages from the [Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi).\r\n\r\n```\r\nconda install pip\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Installation of additional libraries\r\n\r\nWhile we might not have the time to cover them in depth during the tutorial, I would recommend that you have a look at a few extra-libraries (installation instructions below)\r\n\r\n### Basemap\r\n\r\nBasemap is a graphic library for plotting (static, publication quality) geographical maps, see []()\r\n\r\n```\r\nconda install basemap\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Seaborn\r\n\r\nSeaborn\r\n\r\n## Running the IPython notebooks\r\n\r\nThe material of the tutorial is in the form of [IPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). In a nutshell an IPython notebook is a web-based (i.e. running in the browser) interactive computational environment where you can combine Python code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document, which makes it an ideal medium for teaching and exploring.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
